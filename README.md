# Brick Breaker

*Project in the Java language to demonstrate my knowledge in both  the language and object oriented principles.*

The game is the classic Brick Breaker game with options to create a level with text file and block types.

To show that I used right in the object oriented principles, I ~~created~~ a new game [Space Invaders](https://github.com/zomry1/Space_Invaders_OOP) with the same code, only with little changes (Space Invaders).

## Detailed breakdown of the code
First of all, each class file is documents in it.
But here, I will break down the systems in the project:

 - **Animations** - responsible for all the animations and their operating.
 - **Game.Body** - responsible for the running of the game (lives, score and etc)
 - **Game.Mechanics** - responsible for the objects in the game.
 - **Geometry** - responsible for the physics in the game and the shaped that used in it.
 - **Indicators** - responsible for the indicators in game (level name, lives and score)
 - **Listeners** - responsible for update the  game (score, winning, paddle movement)
 - **Menu** - responsible for the menu of the game
 - **Readers** - responsible for read the levels and block definitions.
 - **Score** - responsible for saving the score and the score table
